1.04 Thu Feb  3 15:27:41 GMT 2005
	- Imlib2 1.1.2 broke our tests as it doesn't enable alpha by
          default (for optimisation purposes). The module now enables
          alpha by default when you create an image, but you can turn
          it off with has_alpha (thanks to Don Armstrong)
	- tested with Imlib2 1.2.0
